# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Obviously this is an early prototype/concept.

Please review the README.md of any specific components you want to work on for more advice about how to work with that component.
Please discuss with the owner if you want to try to contribute something significant, to make sure there is alignment on the direction.

## Pull Requests

If you install the pre-commit hooks, among the hooks, you'll see [conventional commits are enforced](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

I will squash commits when merging; the pull request title becomes the first line of the commit message, so should follow conventional commits.

## Don't be an ass

Call out the owner of the repo if he's being an ass to you.
